                <p>Apple</p>
                <p>Site: <a href="https://www.apple.com" target="_blank">apple.com</a></p>

                <p>Visual hierarchy is the principle of arranging elements to show their order of importance. Designers structure visual characteristics—e.g., menu icons—so users can understand information easily. By laying out elements logically and strategically, designers influence users' perceptions and guide them to desired actions.</p>
                <p>Apple utilizes this principle by organizing information with a clear structure, using color, size and placement to guide their users' attention. The site prioritizes features of products and buttons for a overall visually satisfying user experience.</p>

                <p>Hicks Law is a UX design principle to simplify the decision-making process. Hick's Law, also known as Hick-Hyman Law, named after psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman, states that the more options available to a person, the longer it will take to decide which option is best.</p>
                <p>Google utilizes this principle by limiting/simplifying choices and making it easier for their users to make quick choices on the site. Their site is very simple, straighforward which makes it easy for users to find and select options, improving simplicity and usability.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="companyInfo">
                <p>Dropbox</p>

                <p>The white space rule in design recommends using enough blank spaces in a design layout. It means maintaining the spaces between lines of text, paragraphs, and different design elements. 
                    In design, whitespace is a term that refers to negative space. Although it's called white space, it's not always white. In essence, whitespace is just empty space, similar to the invisible air that surrounds us. It can take any color so long as it's devoid of any visual elements, like shapes, text, or images.</p>
                <p>Dropbox utilizes this principle of design by maintaining a clean and neat layout. They use sufficient spacing between elements, which allows room for their content to breathe, creating a visually appealing site. Their design improves readability and keeps their users focused on what matters on the site, leading to a satisfying user-friendly experience.</p>
